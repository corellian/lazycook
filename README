Introduction
============

The website is intended for all of those people who have to cook every day, 
loves the good cuisine, but with no time to think what to cook with the
available ingredients at home.

The point here is to give the maximum importance to the available ingredients
and time.

Application Design Draft
========================

The entry point of the application should be a place where the user can search
for recipes selecting some ingredients and/or some keywords. The application
will show the best matching recipes. Initially, when the user has not searched
anything, the application will show the latest recipes on one column, and the
most popular ones on another column.
